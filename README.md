Welcome to my Github profile! I'm a Information Technology Enthusiast who enjoys exploring on different technologies while looking from a security perspective ðŸ˜Ž

Currently, I'm working on:
- Studying On-prem and Azure Active Directory
- Improving my Japanese speaking ðŸ¤£
- Building my own website

I also play [HackTheBox](https://app.hackthebox.com/users/1688869) CTF Labs regularly and a little bit of Bug Bounty (looking at Government Vulnerability Disclosure programmes)!
